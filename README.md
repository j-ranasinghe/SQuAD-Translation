# SQuAD v1.0 Sinhala Translation Script

This repository provides scripts to translate the [SQuAD v1.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset into **Sinhala** using the **Google Translate API**, and to **clean and validate** the resulting QA data by correcting answer spans and removing invalid entries.

## Features

- Translates **context**, **question**, and **answer** fields to Sinhala.
- Recalculates answer start indices post-translation.
- Filters out QA pairs where the translated answer is not found in the translated context.
- Preserves the SQuAD format for compatibility with existing QA models and tools.
